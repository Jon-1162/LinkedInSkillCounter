GOAL=================================
The goal of this project is to scrape Linkedin jobs for keywords that can result in a report of current job market demands. The keywords this means to aim 
for are skills required for software engineering jobs. 

To analyze the market this high level approach will be taken:
1. Provide a job title to search by
2. Search Linkedin using the job title.
3. Scan the results of the search in a meaningful way to analyze current needs in the American SWE job market.

1. Provide a job title to search by:
    To start with setting a variable in the script should suffice.If this project grows there may be good reason to develop a more sophisticated UI to support
    more in depth searches.

2. Search linkedin using the job title:
    In order to search Linkedin jobs close to programmatically web scraping is a necessary approach due a lack of a real code supported interface. 
    A common stack that used for web scraping is:
    requests + BeautifulSoup  # Quick and simple
    Scrapy                    # Large-scale and structured
    Selenium / Playwright     # JS-heavy sites

    These will provide a basis for the scrapping approach.

3. Scan the results of the search in a meaningful way to analyze current needs in the American SWE job market.
The overall goal of the scan is to extract helpful information on what someone in the job market should learn. To do this effectively there are three main
ways to measure skills for the initial version of this project.
1. In how many jobs a string for a skill occurrences
2. In jobs where the string occurrences what was its frequency compared to other technical skills.
3. Correlation of a string with other string. So where a string occurrences how likely was it to be in the job description with another skill

Analyzing a large number of job should provide for what skills should be learned, the priority of what should be learned, and picturing appropriate skillsets
to pursue to fit roles based on real data.
